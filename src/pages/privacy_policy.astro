        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Summary</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>We collect your <strong>IP address</strong>, <strong>DNS queries</strong>, <strong>active page URL</strong>, and <strong>page text (runtime-only)</strong> to assess website risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Page text and other runtime signals are deleted within 24 hours</strong> and are not used for any purpose other than automated risk checks.</li>
          <li>The only data we persist are <strong>domain-level risk scores</strong> (e.g., <code>example.com → score</code>) and <strong>self-reported domains</strong> you submit—neither is tied to you.</li>
          <li>We <strong>do not sell, rent, or license personal information</strong> to anyone. We also <strong>do not retain, sell, rent, or license personal information</strong> beyond what is necessary for the runtime checks described here.</li>
          <li><strong>No customer data is sent to third parties.</strong></li>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">1) Runtime signals (short-lived; deleted within 24 hours)</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>IP address</strong> (of the requesting device or network egress)</li>
              <li><strong>DNS queries</strong> needed to evaluate a site</li>
              <li><strong>Active page URL</strong> (the address of the site you are visiting)</li>
              <li><strong>Page text (runtime-only):</strong> the visible text of the page may be read by the extension to compute features that help detect malicious behavior. <em>We do not store raw page content beyond 24 hours, and we do not use it for any purpose other than automated risk assessment.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3"><strong>Purpose:</strong> to detect, score, and help prevent potentially malicious activity in real time.</p>
            <p><strong>Retention:</strong> these runtime signals are <strong>ephemeral</strong> and are <strong>deleted within 24 hours</strong> of collection.</p>
            <p><strong>Human access:</strong> page text is evaluated automatically to compute a risk score; <strong>we do not manually review or otherwise “read” your page content</strong>, unless you voluntarily submit a domain report (see below).</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">2) Persisted records (non-personal)</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Domain risk scores:</strong> domain-level entries like <code>domain → risk score</code>. <em>No user identifiers, IP addresses, or page text are stored with these scores.</em></li>
              <li><strong>Self-reported domains:</strong> domains you manually report to us (e.g., false positives/negatives). Stored as domain strings and minimal metadata needed to review reports; <em>not tied to your identity</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3"><strong>Purpose:</strong> to improve detection quality, reduce false positives, and maintain historical risk assessments at the domain level.</p>
            <p><strong>Retention:</strong> retained as needed for accuracy and product improvement. You can request removal of specific self-reported domains (see “Your Rights &amp; Choices”).</p>

          <li>Ephemeral runtime signals based on <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (security, fraud prevention, product functionality).</li>
          <li>Persisted domain scores/self-reports based on <strong>legitimate interests</strong> (maintaining an accurate risk registry).</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Domain scores &amp; self-reported domains:</strong> retained as needed for accuracy and auditability. If you ask us to remove a self-reported domain submission you made, we will do so unless we must retain it for legal or security reasons.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards (e.g., transport encryption, access controls, least-privilege practices). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we aim to minimize retained personal data by design.</p>
