# Safe Browsing — a tiny shield for safer browsing

We’re excited to introduce **Safe Browsing**, a lightweight Chrome extension built to help you browse with confidence. It provides clear alerts when a site may be unsafe — all while keeping your privacy front and center. No tracking, no noise, just safer browsing.

## Why we built Safe Browsing

The web has become crowded with deceptive designs, spoofed domains, and misleading redirects. We wanted a simple way to flag risks early — without slowing down your browser or collecting personal data.

Safe Browsing was created to strike that balance: fast, private, and transparent. It’s designed for anyone who wants a clear signal when something feels off, not a flood of pop-ups.

## What it does

- **Smart detection** — warns you when a page shows signs of phishing or suspicious behavior.  
- **Clean, minimal alerts** — unobtrusive indicators that blend seamlessly into your browsing experience.  
- **Quick actions** — go back safely, copy a URL for review, or open a safe search to verify a site.  
- **Privacy first** — no analytics, no history collection, no third-party tracking.

## How to install

1. Visit the Chrome Web Store:

2. Click **Add to Chrome**.  
3. Pin the extension for quick visibility in your toolbar.

## Built for trust

Safe Browsing was designed with transparency in mind.  
We don’t collect or sell data, and the extension works entirely locally.  
Optional diagnostics, if enabled, are anonymized and exist only to improve detection accuracy — never to track users.

---

## What’s next

We’re already planning updates to refine detection accuracy and introduce opt-in phishing reporting. A technical deep dive into our design and heuristics will follow soon for those curious about how it all works under the hood.

## Try it out

We believe safer browsing should be simple, private, and fast.
